Database schema for the Experts@Minnesota Data Warehouse.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The following diagrams are exports from [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/),
based on the [experts.mwb](experts.mwb) file. Note that the primary key constraint names in that file
are inaccurate, because MySQL Workbench seems to insist on naming them 'PRIMARY'. No luck overriding
that so far.
